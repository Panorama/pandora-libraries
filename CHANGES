0.0.3 REM: Slight fixup (if you can call it that) to replace copy/paste code with SEARCHPATH_PRE/POST pathiter.h
      REM: Added .so to Makefile
      REM: Added extern "C" wrappers for headers; just maybe this will help someone :P
      REM: Added 'locatetest' shitty test tool to verify pnd_locate code pretends to work; needs the
           shared lib version so you need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, for what its worth

0.0.2 REM: Working on INOTIFY in what little time I have before Christmas :)
      REM: I'm sick as hell.
      NEW: Added notifytest, pnd_notify.[ch]
      	   Seems to work 'okay' in a brute force fashion; only watching a couple events right now and
	   didn't test yet against mount/unmount and such, but a start.

Overview
--------

libpnd is a basic collection of functions and tools to make working Pandora-specific
operations easier; to wit, it is hoped multiple applications will make use of this
library rather than re-implement similar functionality and lead to problems down the
road. (Instead we can run into problems together and thus clobberize them.)

The library is broken into parts:

include	    - include these files to make use of the lib
lib	    - the code that produces the lib
test	    - mini tools to test various pieces of the lib in isolation
bin	    - test tools
testdata/   - for testing /etc/pandora; will contain 'conf' dir, for example

Revisions
---------

The initial version of this code will be very limited and meant to kick-start further
work, yet provide basic functionaliy.

TODO
----

o We need an actual matchbox plugin that uses this lib to obtain app list

o PND-file handling, so iso/cram/zip app bundles actually work when pnd_apps_exec()'d

o PXML parser has to actually be an XML parser

o UNICODE support? ie: paths and filenames and app-names..

Nice to do:

o Handle regexp's or globbing in searchpaths, so can do tricks like /mnt/*/app etc

PS: Yes, I know, the entire thing could be done in 20 lines of perl, but we wanted C to
maximize availability.

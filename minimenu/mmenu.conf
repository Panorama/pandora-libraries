# for the mmenu 'minimenu'
#

# Note on overriding whats in a .pnd-application/PXML.xml
# Note that you can perform icon name, clockspeed setting and category overrides via an .ovr file
# Note that the icon can be overridden for a pnd-file by making a same-name .png file, in the same location
# "Notes" can be added to an icon using the .ovr file, as well.

# Skins
# There is a a searchpath to find skin subdirs in; built in skins are in /etc/pandora/mmenu/skins,
# so any subdirectory of that is a skin-name. (ie: /etc/pandora/mmenu/skins/default is skin named 'default')
# Each skin will have its own mmskin.conf file defining how the skin works. All other options should be
# here, so that skin-changes do not break user preferences

scroll_increment	4	# number of rows to scroll when jumping up or down (recommend 1, or same as row_max for full page jump)

[categories]
do_all_cat		1		# if >0, will show an All category; if 0, skip it, just your cats.
# Normally for mmenu, an encountered category is just used as is. 5 cats exist, you get 5 tabs.
# If map_on is >0, then category transforms will occur
#   @NEWCAT oldcat1:oldcat2	 <- means oldcat1, if found, will map to NEWCAT. "@" is discarded.
#   NOTE: FreeDesktop rules do not allow categories with spaces in the name; if needed, I can add it with quoting.
# If map_default_on is set (>0), then any unmapped categories will be forced into the default category bucket (map_default_cat.)
#   If map_default_on is off (=0), then unmapped categories will become their own categories as normal.
#   Should probably still have an @ line to create the default category, since creating the cats comes before assigning defaults
# NOTE: Individual app overrides occur at the time of app scanning, so before this category mapping occurs and thus is effected
map_on			0		# if >0, will do category mapping at all; if 0, don't do any of this.
map_default_on		0		# if >0, any unmapped category will get forced to map_default_cat; set to 0 to leave unmapped cats alone
map_default_cat		Spam		# see map_default_on
# NOTE: List the categories in reverse order to how you wish them in the tab list; last one shows up as first tab

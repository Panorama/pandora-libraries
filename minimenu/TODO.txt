- libpnd: merge overrides, fix it up;
  - full-replacement PXML is one option, another is
  - apply override to all sections that match -- by unique-id, so apply override to all sub-apps that apply?

- libpnd: appdata-dir-name?

- add font and fontcolour control to conf
- About screen and shoutouts // konami code?
- skinning .. mmenu.conf and then skin.conf in each skin dir?
  - skin picker/saver

- some ultra primtive frame draw, so the 'detail menu' and any 'sub menus' can draw
  their own frame rather than depand on skin frame to exist
- deploy..
  - .desktop for deployment, for running from xfce

- maybe:
  - directory browser; easy hack

- future
  - honor render_mask to know what to update
  - handle SD eject/insert? or leave on manual
  - add callback to pnd_disco_Search (maybe new func to not break cpas code), so can show number apps found so far
  - note taking field

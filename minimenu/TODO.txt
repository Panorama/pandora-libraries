- libpnd: merge overrides, fix it up;
  - full-replacement PXML is one option, another is
  - apply override to all sections that match -- by unique-id, so apply override to all sub-apps that apply?

- add check .. if fail to load, during skin load, and also using non-default skin, delete skin-pref file
  and restart in hopes default is not borked
- add font and fontcolour control to conf
- Perhaps a seriesof conf sections for per-file-extension or per-mimetype or both
  [Section-FILEEXT] and [Section-MIMETYPE]
  icon		    /some/path
  invoke	    /path/to/proggy/to/run/it
  -- this would thus let us do things like invoke a video player
  -- alternative: parse the MIME handlers for xfce (say), to poach the info. Could be really slow.

- some ultra primtive frame draw, so the 'detail menu' and any 'sub menus' can draw
  their own frame rather than depand on skin frame to exist
  	- ie: some system for handling basic UI for setting changes, without conf hacking
- deploy..
  - .desktop for deployment, for running from xfce

- future
  - handle SD eject/insert? or leave on manual
  - add callback to pnd_disco_Search (maybe new func to not break cpas code), so can show number apps found so far

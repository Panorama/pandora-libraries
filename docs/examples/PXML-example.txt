The best and most-current PXML example (if overly comprehensive) is here:

http://pandorawiki.org/PXML_archetype

Various stages of PXML.xml files are shown here. They show the minimum that
still validates with the schema, the minimum that is usable on the pandora, as
well as some examples of average and "full" case. At the top of each file you
will find a short summary what this PXML.xml file tries to show.

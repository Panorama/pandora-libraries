Various stages of PXML.xml files are shown in this folder. They show the minimum
that still validates with the schema, the minimum that is usable on the pandora,
as well as some examples of average and "full" case. At the top of each file you
will find a short summary what this PXML.xml file tries to show.

Beside this you should rely on the information provided in the PXML specs as
e.g. shown in the wiki:

http://www.pandorawiki.org/PXML_specification

Other sources in the wiki might be outdated and not conforming the recent specs.
If you want to be save regarding the examples, make sure to check the files in
this folder!

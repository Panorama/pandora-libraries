- pndnotifyd drops icons into a conf'd location (/tmp currently); it skips emitting them if that path is already
  present (saves time after first emit!) .. the risk here is that the icon has changed or been removed, and we just
  keep using the old one. Perhaps pndnotifyd should check the length of the icon (or a CRC32 or something), on occasion?

- pndnotifyd doesn't delete icons; it leaves them in /tmp as a cache of sorts. /tmp may not be wisest if it gets turfed on
  boot, but I'm up in the air on that one; we want caching, but not unlimited lifespan, so /tmp seems useful. (Unless /tmp
  is in RAM, which it could be, should check.) ANYWAY, my point is..
     - should we conf how many icons/bytes can be consumed in 'cache' this way?
     - more to point, should we remove old icons (ie: say, a week old) by default, so occasional re-caching occurs, but
       we also clean up unused icons? We could also keep an access-count or somesuch. Just sayin'

- fill in the blanks in pnd-logger

- more useful PXML.xml parser, to cover all the fields and provide iterators, and better support the treelike nature

- applist memleak; ie: all those disco_t apps returned are never free'd properly
  include/pnd_discovery.h:// TODO: A way to release the disco-lists and reclaim RAM :)

- put in code to fetch clock speed, and add clock speed handler to pnd_apps_exec? maybe unify the whole emit-dotdesktop and
  exec routines o they dont' have two representations of command line args ..

- remove -u's from pnd_apps_exec and pnd_emit_dotdesktop?

- replace brute force memcmp() in pnd pnd with a fancy pants CS alg
- make pnd_pndfiles seek of PXML more efficient; fread ( 1, nmemb ) gotta be slow :)

- review pnd_tinyxml to ensure the PXML_FILENAME is csae insensitive as needed

- fix is_pxml_valid_app() .. right now it always returns 1!

- make accrued PXML from pnd-buffer growable, not locked at 32k/X size

- make sensible override code, so it picks up all fields... or compares fields; not just copies _en

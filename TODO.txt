Some things to be done..

- UNICODE everywhere.. this will be a lot of work I'm sure. (replacing all the char* and related consumers)

- applist memleak; ie: all those disco_t apps returned are never free'd properly
  include/pnd_discovery.h:// TODO: A way to release the disco-lists and reclaim RAM :)

- put in code to fetch clock speed, and add clock speed handler to pnd_apps_exec

- remove -u's from pnd_apps_exec and pnd_emit_dotdesktop

- replace brute force memcmp() in pnd pnd with a fancy pants CS alg
- make pnd_pndfiles seek of PXML more efficient; fread ( 1, nmemb ) gotta be slow :)

- review pnd_tinyxml to ensure the PXML_FILENAME is csae insensitive as needed

- fix is_pxml_valid_app() .. right now it always returns 1!

- make accrued PXML from pnd-buffer growable, not locked at 32k/X size

- make sensible override code, so it picks up all fields... or compares fields; not just copies _en

apps/pndnotifyd.c:// TODO: Catch HUP and reparse config
apps/pndnotifyd.c:// TODO: Should perhaps direct all printf's through a vsprintf handler to avoid redundant "if ! g_daemon_mode"
  apps/pndnotifyd.c:// TODO: During daemon mode, should perhaps syslog or log errors

Some things to be done..

- replace brute force memcmp() in pnd pnd with a fancy pants CS alg

- review pnd_tinyxml to ensure the PXML_FILENAME is csae insensitive as needed
- fix pnd_tinyxml.. why does it need 'if ( s )' protection. it assumes some filename weird stuff
    - why does it need filenames at all for icons/etc?!

- fix is_pxml_valid_app() .. right now it always returns 1!

- make pnd_pndfiles seek of PXML more efficient; fread ( 1, nmemb ) gotta be slow :)

- make accrused PXML from pnd-buffer growable, not locked at 32k/X size
